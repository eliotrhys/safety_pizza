Write the .customer method for our PizzaOrder class and the .pizza_orders method for our Customer class.

.customer method:

Our Order objects know their own @customer_id
We can use this in our SQL statement (use SqlRunner) to get back the customer data.
Our .customer method should return a Customer object, an instance of the Customer class
.pizza_orders method:

Our Customer objects know their own @id
We can use this in our SQL statement (use SqlRunner) to get back the data for all of their orders.
Our .pizza_orders method should return an array of PizzaOrder objects, instances of the PizzaOrder class
